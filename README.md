This is a browser game based off of the famous Atari Game Frogger. 

Rules:
The rules of the game are simple: Get the frog from the city (brown bar along the bottom of the screen) to the forest (dark green bar across the top of the screen). 

Play:
In order to do get the frog to the forest, the player must move the frog using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

The first obstacle the frog will encounter is a highway full of speeding vehicles. Dodge these vehicles and make it across the road, otherwise the frog will be ran over and the game will end.

Once the frog makes it safely across the highway, the next obstacle is the river. The frog must make it across the river without falling into the water in order to proceed to the forest. In order to do this, the frog must ride on the backs of the turtles(green squares) or castaway on a log(brown rectangles).

If you make it across the river, CONGRATULATIONS! You've won the game. Once completed, the players score will be tallied and a new game will start.

I hope you enjoy!
